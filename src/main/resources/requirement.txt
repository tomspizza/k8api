Story
Assume I want to deploy my services on K8, But I dont know much about K8 and does not like to deal with the complexities of K8.
Therefore I need few rest APIs which wraps K8 APIs so that I can easily, deploy/delete/list/scale and call my deployed services on K8

API Details
POST /k8/ingress/create - Optional, I don't need this, but you may be putting ur effort on this
POST /k8/deploy   {"image": "test.azurecr.io/integration/raspberry-service:1.0", "namespace":"test", servicename":"raspberry-service"} => 200 OK | Error Code + Description
POST /k8/delete   {"namespace":"test", "servicename":"raspberry-service"} -> 200 OK | Error Description
GET  /k8/list =>  Array of these {"namespace":"test", "servicename":"raspberry-service", "Serciceurl" : "123.214.45.12:8080/service1/", "image": "test.azurecr.io/integration/raspberry-service:1.0", "uptime":5 , "deployed"="20210809", "state": "running|stoped|crashed", "logs": "path/to/find/logs", "metadata":"any valuable data related to pods like cup, mem,disk usage"}
POST /k8/scale {"namespace":"test", "servicename":"raspberry-service", "numberofreplicas"="1|2|3"}   validate 0< numberofreplicas < 10 

Deploy
When I call deploy fir the first time it should deploy the service via ingress
When i call deploy afterwords, it should not be creating new ingresses, but update the previous ingress to add the relevant configs
I should be able to call my services through ingress ip
GET/POST http://ingress-ip/myserivce1/my/service1/paths
GET/POST http://ingress-ip/myserivce2/my/other/service2/paths

Delete
When a service is deleted, it should delete all other kubernetes resources associated with that, should update the ingress entries too

List
List should list the a json array of already deployed services, each array item should represent a service.
Should return as much information as possible, Its state, uptime, pod details, image details, scale details (num of replicas), and how to locate that service (ingress url for this)

Scale
I should be able to scale up/down

Development expectations
Should use Spring boot + java, maven
No scripting or process calls should be used
Need to use the K8 java API, https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-kubernetes-objects-using-kubernetes-api-1baea18f54c1 is a sample
API's should be blocking to provide me the results of API invocation, where it was success or failed
If success it should return 200 OK, if fails should give me details of failure in the status message
You may suggest any valuable ideas of ur expertise and I'm open to do minor changes
